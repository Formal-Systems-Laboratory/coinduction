theory/
contains some developments about the foundations,
acceptable forms of decidable rules, higher order proofs, etc.

This is more than we need for the first round of examples,
where transitivity and step seem to be enough for derived rules,
and first order properties suffice.

common/
Define the proof principles specialized to transitivity,
and also a representation of map with an ACU equivalence
relation, and some lemmas on that

implementation/
Define an example language, and prove properties of
a bunch of example programs.

himp/
contains some old stuff
