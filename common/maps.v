(** ** Map Equality Tactic

  The map equality tactic [equate_maps] tries to solve map equations involving
  at most one map-typed evar.

  The general approach is to put both maps into a standard form,
  as a sequence of singleton items and residual map-typed variables,
  then cancel entries between the sides, until everything that's
  left can be absorbed into the evar (or we're stuck with
  a residual equation).
 *)

(** *** Finding items in a map
    These are the tactics for commuting target items to the
    head of a map *)

(** Specializing congruence for the find tactic *)
Definition equivJoinL {K V} (r : Map K V) l1 l2 pfl : l1 :* r ~= l2 :* r :=
  equivJoin pfl (equivRefl r).
Definition equivJoinR {K V} (l : Map K V) r1 r2 pfr :  l :* r1 ~= l :* r2 :=
  equivJoin (equivRefl l) pfr.

(** Find an entry with key [x] in map [map].
    If found, it calls the continuation tactic [k] on
    an equality of the form [map ~= x |-> _ :* _],
    otherwise it simply fails.

(** Find an entire map [submap] appearing exactly all or part of a map [map].
    It's expeted that [submap] be a variable, this tactic makes no attempt
    to search search up to map equality if [submap] is a more complicated

(** *** Map well-formedness predicates

    [check_maps] checks that each map is right associated,
    has items before map-typed ordinary variables before
    evars, and that there is at most one evar, on the right side.

    [is_map_exp] is also used elsewhere, and succeeds only if the given
    map is neither an evar nor any of the map constructors.
 *)

(** *** Preparing maps.

    An equation is prepared by using any map equation hypotheses to
    expand variables in the maps involed,
    then using map equalities to remove empties, right-associate
    unions, and move singleton items to the front.

    This tactic isn't entirely careful about locating evars,
    but they are checked afterwards.
 *)

(* *** Solving the map equation

   After preparing the maps, the left side has no evars, so the non-evar
   part of the RHS must appear as a submap of the left side.

   This tactic proceeds item by item, finding and cancelling identical
   items between sides.
   If this ends with an equation between a map and an evar it is
   instantiated.

   If the equation isn't completely solved, the tactic still succeeds,
   leaving the reduced equation.
